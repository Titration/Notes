There are two different kinds of hash tables: hash set and hash map.
* The `hash set` is one of the implementations of a `set` data structure to store `no repeated values`.
* The `hash map` is one of the implementations of a `map` data structure to store `(key, value)` pairs.

By choosing a proper hash function, the hash table can achieve `wonderful performance` in both **insertion and search**.
