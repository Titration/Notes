## 485. Max Consecutive Ones [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)
Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

### Need to know
```
Math.max(dataType num1, dataType num2);
The datatypes can be int, float, double or long.
```
> Returns: maximum of two numbers


### How can I do better next time?
1. Practice more.


### Solutions
#### Intuition
> Idea: We keep a count of the number of 1's encountered. And reset the count whenever we encounter anything other than 1.
```
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        
        int count = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;
        for (int item : nums) {
            if (item == 1) {
                count++;
            }
            else {
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return Math.max(maxCount, count);
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.
* Space Complexity: O(1). We do not use any extra space.
